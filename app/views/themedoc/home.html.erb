					<div>“Set Up Wordpress and your Nightsprout Theme”</div>
				</h3>
				<p>Before you install a Nightsprout theme, you have to have a working WordPress install.  Anything that we write here will probably pale in comparison to the existing WordPress Documentation.  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Getting_Started_with_WordPress">Click here to give it a read.</a></p>
				<p>Once you have that set up, getting Empire on your system is relatively easy.  You have a few options, but we suggest this way for most users:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Via the WordPress Admin Panel
				    <ol>
				      <li>Log in to WordPress as the admin user.</li>
				      <li>Click on the "Appearance" menu item, and then the "Themes" sub-menu item inside of it.</li>
				      <li>Click on the "Install Themes", and then the "Upload" sub-tab below it.</li>
				      <li>Click on the "Choose File" button and browse to the location of the theme's zip file.</li>
				      <li>Select the file, and click "Install Now".</li>
				    </ol>
				  </li>
				</ul>
				<p>If this doesn't work for you, there are other common methods to install a theme <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes">well documented here on the WordPress Documentation site.</a> If you have any problems installing your theme, feel free to <a href="http://cssframework.heroku.com/themedoc/home#">contact our customer support</a>.</p>

				</h3>
				<p>To get started, lets configure your front page.  If you don't want to use your Nightsprout Front Page, skip to Chapter 2, which details what to do to deactivate it or otherwise make it not the main page of your site.</p>
				<p>Inside of the WordPress Admin interface, click on the "Empire Config" option in the main menu.  It should be one of the first options.  This will take you to Nightsprout's custom theme administration panel.  The first page you see is the Front Page Settings area, where you can customize the look of the Nightsprout Front Page.</p>
				<p>The first set of options is the <em>Banner Gallery</em>.  Here, you can specify which images you want to use for the rotating front page image gallery.  Inside of each text box, you need to input the full URL address for the images you want to post (or the relative ones if you're an advanced user and have the correct relative path).  To the right of each of the URL text inputs, we've placed buttons that will open the default WordPress Media Uploader.  Here you can upload your own images, or browse the images that you've already uploaded yourself.</p>
				<p><b>NOTE:</b> you can NOT use the "Insert into post" option, or anything similar in this instance.  You must use the Link URL, which can be found by clicking "Show" next to an image thumbnail, and it must be the "File URL" version of the URL, which can be obtained by clicking the "File URL" button below the "Link URL"</p>

				<p>The front page isn't for everyone.  If you don't think you want to use it, or you don't want the Front Page to be the default main page of your blog, this is the section for you.  If you want to keep your Front Page, skip this section. </p>
				<p>For ease of use, we've overwritten a default setting for WordPress.  Usually, WordPress expects the default page to be the list of blog posts.  We have changed this to be our custom Front Page interface.  If you wish to undo this, it is simple, but it requires following these steps that act somewhat against the standard WordPress settings:</p>
				<ol>
				  <li>Click on the "Pages" menu item, and then the "Add New" sub-menu item inside of it.</li>
				  <li>Enter the Title as "Blog", or whatever you want your Blog section to be called.</li>
				  <li>In the "Page Attributes" section of this page, under the "Template" heading, click on the drop-down selector and then click on the "Blog" option.</li>
	        <li>Save this page.  It will be your new front page.</li>
	        <li>If you still wish to use the Nightsprout Front Page, just not as the default first page of your site, repeat steps 1-4, except name it appropriately and click on "Nightsprout Front Page" under the "Template" dropdown.</li>
				  <li>Click on the "Settings" menu item, and then the "Reading" sub-menu item inside of it.</li>
				  <li>Next to the "Front Page Displays" option on this page, click on the radio button next to "A static page"</li>
				  <li>Click on the drop-down next to "Front Page" and select the page you set up for your Blog.</li>
				  <li>If you set up a secondary page for your Nightsprout Front Page, select it in the drop down menu next to "Posts Page".</li>

					<span>Chapter X: Our CSS Files</span>
					<div>“The Cascade Handles the Work so You Don't Have To!”</div>
				</h3>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Let's talk about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css">CSS</a> (By the way, if you are an extra-savvy web person, you might be interested to know that our CSS is derived from <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS/SCSS</a>. We will also cover that topic <a href="#">later in this section</a>.). If you are unfamiliar with CSS, you can find a starter tutorial at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>. If you're planning to make use of CSS to modify your theme, it is best you have some prior understanding of how it works. This section will <strong>not</strong> teach you how to write CSS. It is designed to teach those of you who know CSS how our CSS is set up so that you can tweak it to your own preferences. It is likely you will be completely satisfied with our many baked-in theme variations (great for beginning users) but we also want to make sure to give you as much control over your theme as possible. Heard enough? Let's get started.</p>
					<p>Your theme's visual presentation is controlled by two stylesheets:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><a href="#">screen.css</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">empire.css</a></li>
					</ol>
					<p>Screen.css is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_frameworks">CSS Framework</a> that sets the presentation of the site to reasonable defaults. Nightsprout uses screen.css as a default for all of our Wordpress themes. Some of the automagical things it does include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Position everything on page,</li>
						<li>make the typography beautiful and consistent,</li>
						<li>tame form elements: inputs/buttons/etc.,</li>
						<li>create commonly-used elements, such as lined lists,</li>
						<li>... and more!</li>
					</ul>
					<p>One thing to note about screen.css is that it sets almost every HTML element to have the following rules applied:</p>
					<code class="prettyprint">
						<ol>
							<li>div, table, blockquote, code, pre, nav, address, cite,</li>
							<li>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, ol, ul, li, dl, dt, dd,</li>
							<li>fieldset, legend, form, label, select,</li>
							<li>input[type="text"], input[type="email"], input[type="password"], textarea {</li>	
							<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;display: block;</li>
							<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;float: left;</li>
							<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;width: 100%;</li>
							<li>}</li>
						</ol>
					</code>
					<p>All Nightsprout themes use this block/float method of positioning because it is well-supported by all browsers. If you've used the <a href="http://blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS</a> framework before, then you are probably already familiar with it. When making any custom changes to the CSS, be aware that elements should be floated or <a href="http://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/06/new-clearfix-hack/">cleared</a>. In general, you do not need to edit screen.css file. Any changes you make to this file will have wide-reaching effects because it controls the most generalized style rules. Therefore, be weary if you choose to edit this file; a good rule of thumb would be <em>"Avoid making changes to screen.css!"</em>.</p>
					<p>The second file, empire.css, is where you will make changes should you choose to make any. Empire.css overrides screen.css and contains the unique look and feel to your theme. Some of the things it controls are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Sizing of various elements,</li>
						<li>colors and color themes,</li>
						<li>inclusion of images and other assets,</li>
						<li>presentation of the theme's unique elements,</li>
						<li>... and more!</li>
					</ul>
					<p>It is acceptable to edit empire.css. However, in the interest of easily maintaining any custom CSS you might add, we suggest overriding it instead. Simply add a third stylesheet which will contain your overrides and request that file after screen.css and empire.css.</p>
					<p>The next section will cover SCSS. You can read more about it on <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">their website</a>. If you know CSS, you'll love using SCSS. It takes away a lot of the headache of developing with plain CSS, especially when you use it with <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>. In fact, that's why we use it!</p>
				</div>
				<!-- .section -->
				<h4>Our Suite of SCSS Files</h4>
				<p>This section is for people who know SASS/SCSS and want to get a little more in-depth with their customizations. Feel free to ignore it if this does not apply to you. As an added bonus for purchasing this theme, we've provided you with our source SCSS files free of charge. These SCSS files compile into the CSS we talked about in the previous section.</p>
				<p>As mentioned earlier, screen.css is the basic framework any Nightsprout theme starts with. However, this file is actually comprised of three SCSS files:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>screen.scss</li>
					<li>_vollkorn.scss</li>
					<li>_open-sans.scss</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Why do we include those two SCSS partials in screen.scss? Well, they are the magic sauce that makes everything line up nicely in your browser. Every font falls on a different vertical height. Therefore, each font needs its own special style rules to make it sit on the right line height. These font partials compensate for those differences. Nightsprout has created partials for several fonts found on <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google's open font API</a>. Screen.scss requests two font files - one for headers and one for body copy:</p>
				<code class="prettyprint">
					<ol>
						<li>@import "open-sans"; /* Request Nightsprout's partial for the Google font "Open Sans". */</li>
						<li>@import "vollkorn"; /* Request Nightsprout's partial for the Google font "Vollkorn". */</li>
						<li>&nbsp;</li>
						<li>html {</li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;@include font-theme-header-vollkorn; /* Include mixin from partial for headers. */</li>
						<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;@include font-theme-body-open-sans; /* Include mixin from partial for body copy and everything else. */</li>
						<li>}</li>
					</ol>
				</code>
				<p>If you wish to upgrade fonts on your page, we suggest using the design patterns found in the font partials we provide. It is possible to simply do a search/replace in the SCSS/CSS for a font name, but creating a new font partial is more robust and you'll find that you can make all the text line up to a very consistent baseline.</p>
				<p>Empire.css is also derived from a SCSS file (aptly named empire.scss). It is not comprised of other files but takes advantage of SCSS in two ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>All the colors have been broken out into a "Color Theme" section. This allows you to change the colors of the theme without having to do complex search/replaces on hex color values.</li>
					<li>Where possible, we have used mixins for browser-specific effects, such as box shadows, border radii, and gradients.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The color feature is the most relevant to you. Rather than searching the document to change colors, you can simply edit the Color Theme section and make color changes there. The color variables are set up in such a way that they are grouped semantically, making it easier to make changes. Please note that your theme <strong>does</strong> ship with out-of-the-box color variations. This feature is simply there as an added bonus.</p>

					<h4>Common Mistake #1: Inappropriately Sized Images</h4>
					<p>One common mistake you see on almost ever WordPress blog are images that just don't seem to fit in the space the are given. A wrongly sized image can cause all kinds of spacing issues like monstrous gaps in the page, overflows into other columns, or even worse breakages!</p>
					<p>
						<img style="display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 31px;" src="images/ns-documentation/image-sizing-1.png" alt="Poorly formatted image." />
						<img style="display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 31px;" src="images/ns-documentation/image-sizing-2.png" alt="Poorly formatted image." />
						<img style="display: block; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" src="images/ns-documentation/image-sizing-3.png" alt="Poorly formatted image." />
						Look at the three images of blog posts on the right. Which of the blog posts has a correctly formatted image? The answer should be obvious!
